# Election Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Challenge Overview
This analysis was interesting to do for the simple reason that it helped me understand that indentation within Python is very important. It took me quite some time to realize that there were lines not working correctly due to something as simple as indentation and proper punctuation.

## Challenge Summary
The winner of the election was Diana DeGette. The code for this analysis helped me better understand how to read and write information to files outside of itself.
This script can be modified to be used in other elections by changing what .csv file is read and where it is written to.
